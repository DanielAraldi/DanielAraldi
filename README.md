# Hello World! I'm Daniel Sansão Araldi 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Web and Mobile Front-end Developer, but also I have knowledge and experience with Back-end development. Here's a bit about me:

## ✨ About me:

I'm a Systems Development Technician by [SENAI](https://sc.senai.br/) and currently studying Computer Science at Univali at [UNIVALI](https://www.univali.br/). I have been inside development studying for 6 years, and I have 3 years with a professional developer as a front-end and back-end.

I have already participated in ERP systems for signing electronic invoices and administration using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Java Spring Boot**. Also, I have experience with administrator panels around deliveries, management, and schools using the technologies React and Next.js.

Finally, I have significant experience with mobile app development done in **React Native** focused on areas of fintech, catalogs, inventory control, and others. I highlight my knowledge of building native modules for **Android (Java)** and **iOS (Swift and Objective-C/C++)**, and on the creation of libraries for **React Native** for publishing in **NPM**.
