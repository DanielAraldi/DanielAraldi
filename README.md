# Hello World! I'm Daniel Sansão Araldi 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Web and Mobile Front-end Developer, but I also have knowledge and experience with Back-end development. Here's a bit about me:

## ✨ About me

I'm a Systems Development Technician by [SENAI](https://sc.senai.br/) and currently studying Computer Science at [Univali](https://www.univali.br/). I have been inside development studying for 6 years, and I have 3 years with a professional developer as a front-end and back-end.

I have already participated in **ERP systems** for signing electronic invoices and administration using Node.js, Express.js, and Java Spring Boot. Also, I have experience with **administrator panels** around deliveries, management, and schools using technologies React and Next.js.

Finally, I have significant experience with **mobile app development** done in React Native focused on areas of fintech, catalogs, inventory control, and others. I highlight my knowledge of building native modules for Android (Java) and iOS (Swift and Objective-C/C++) and creating libraries for React Native for publishing in NPM.

Currently, I am working on the [LEMA](https://github.com/DanielAraldi/LEMA) project at [Univali](https://www.univali.br/), an oceanography project to link three services to manage geospatial data around the world.

All this experience helped me build a good base development and understand the needs and client's wishes. These technical features made me a developer very careful with the app details that I've developed and still develop. If you want to know more about me, you can call me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-sansão-araldi-8b23b71b5). Thank you, see you soon 😄.
