Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a web and mobile front-end developer, but I also have knowledge and experience with back-end development. Here's a bit about me:

I'm a Systems Development Technician by [SENAI](https://sc.senai.br/) and currently studying Computer Science at [Univali](https://www.univali.br/). I have been in development studying for 7 years, and I have 4 years of experience as a professional developer, with a front-end and a little bit of back-end 😄.

I’m a builder and creator of UI libraries for React Native. I also develop native modules and native components for biometrics and facial document scanning.

Currently working as a front-end mobile developer with React, React Native, Swift, Objective-C++ (iOS), Java, and Kotlin (Android) at [Azify](https://azify.com/). 

Creator of the [react-native-blur-view](https://github.com/DanielAraldi/react-native-blur-view) library and collaborator of the [react-native-blur](https://github.com/sbaiahmed1/react-native-blur).
